Final Project Readme:

This is my code for the solution to the final project in Data Structures and Algorithms II - C950.


There are 2 ways to load the program:
 
1) Load "Final Project Code" folder into a Python editor and specify Main.py as the run file

2) Use Command Prompt, type in the path where the "Final Project Code" folder is stored and press enter, then type in " python Main.py"
    for example:
        c:\cd\Users\brian\OneDrive\Documents\WGU Files\WGU\Data Structures and Algorithms II\Final Project\Final Project Code
 	c:\Users\brian\OneDrive\Documents\WGU Files\WGU\Data Structures and Algorithms II\Final Project\Final Project Code> python Main.py
